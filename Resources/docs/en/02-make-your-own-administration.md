Make your own administration
============================

Since this bundle is a simple tool, it doesn't do so much. You have to do your usually work:
*  Making a controller
*  Writing routing
*  Making your entities
*  Making your form types
*  Making your own (functional) test

1) The controller
-----------------

You don't have to write any action but the most part of configuration to do is in your controller.

Create your controller and extends from "Nekland\Bundle\BaseAdmin\Controller\CrudController".
